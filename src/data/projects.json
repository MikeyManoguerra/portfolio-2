The LandSat 8 API returns 500 errors if no image exists per the request, and since most of the earth is water by surface area, this is a lot of errors. Views via Iss handles errors, stores successful responses, and allows changing the parameters of the location. The next step is to allow to search through your session's successful requests. Another addition would be to find another live-location data source with a circum-polar orbit.",
